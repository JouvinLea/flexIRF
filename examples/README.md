==============

This folder contains several examples of FITS files generated using flexIRF software. They all may be generated using the examples described [here](../README.md).

The following FITS files are available:


```shell  
testEffArea.fits       
testParamEffArea.fits
alltest.fits
testRoot2FITS_converter.fits
```

**Detailed description will be ready soon...**

testEffArea.fits       
--------------

This file, generated by the "IRFsimpleWriteIrf.cc" macro, contains the information defining a mock effective area as a histogram of 9 bins. The information is distributed as follows:



```shell  
> ftlist testEffArea.fits H

        Name               Type       Dimensions
        ----               ----       ----------
HDU 1   Primary Array      Null Array                               
HDU 2   ENERGY_BINS        BinTable     1 cols x 10 rows            
HDU 3   EFFAREA_NUM        Image      Real4(9)
